            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I trained to be a nutritionist because I enjoy helping others. In fact, the best (and most important) part of my job is when a client’s health improves as he or she starts to make healthier food choices. With the number of illnesses caused by poor nutrition on the rise, I’m grateful that I can make a difference in people’s lives.</p>

            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I’m a cross between a computer geek, a teacher and an entrepreneur. (I’ve been all of them at one time or another.) After years of working in both the corporate and non-profit worlds, I found myself “down-sized” a few years ago. I launched a couple of home-based businesses including one where I went to small businesses and taught people about technology and how to create an online presence. My motto then was “Big Business Solutions for Small Business Budgets”. Since then, I’ve self-published a book, dabbled in website design and marketed Virtual Tour photography.</p>
